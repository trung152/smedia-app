          solely for User's personal use. As used herein, "User" includes also
          Our paying customers ("Customers"). This Agreement sets forth certain
          terms and conditions that apply to Customers, but not other Users. In
          the event any Customer-specific terms or conditions conflict with any
          of the terms or conditions that apply to Users generally, the
          Customer-specific terms/conditions shall control. We may change,
          suspend or discontinue the Services at any time, including the
          availability of any feature, database, or content. We may also impose
          limits on certain features and services or restrict User's access to
          parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. User
          certifies to us that if User is an individual (i.e., not a
          corporation) User is at least 13 years of age. User also certifies
          that it is legally permitted to use the Service, and takes full
          responsibility for the selection and use of the Service. This
          Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the
          Service is revoked in such jurisdictions. User shall be responsible
          for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services
          needed to connect to, access the Service, including, without
          limitation, modems, hardware and software. User shall be responsible
          for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible
